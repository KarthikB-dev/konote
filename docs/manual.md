# konote 

Konote is designed to be a multipurpose productivity tool. It currently only supports task generation.

## Tasks

There are three main types of tasks - long term goals, projects, and quick todos. 

The main purpose of these tasks is to log todos that do not have a due date. 

### Long term goals
These are things like learning a new language, acquiring a new skill, or taking a course.

In the console, type `konote ltg <name of long term goal>` to add one to your list.

### Projects
These are the next level below. It might be something like learning a specific grammar

structure within the language, learning a certain skill, or completing a project

within that course.

In the console, type `konote pr <name of long term goal>` to add one to your list.

### Quick todos
These are things you can get done in less than an hour, like doing a problem set,
getting a workout done, or cleaning your room.

In the console, type `konote qt <name of long term goal>` to add one to your list.

### Viewing tasks that were made
Go to your home directory, then a folder named `konote_files` and find a file called `Tasks.yaml`.

This file stores all the tasks you have made. You can edit it directly, and new tasks will be created

## Coming Features

### Frequency Based todos. 

For example you might brush your teeth twice a day, go for a walk once a day, and do bicep curls every other day.

Konote would be able to remind you of this.

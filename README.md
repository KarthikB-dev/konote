# konote
This project has not yet been completed and so has very limited functionality as of now.


## What is konote in one sentence?
konote is an application centered on improving your productivity. It is currently only for logging tasks.

## Why should I use konote?
One of its main planned features is being able to nest tasks. For example, you might have tasks that requires you

to do the dishes. This task contains other tasks within it, such as buying dish soap or a sponge.


Another feature of konote that is very valuable is frequency based todos. You could have tasks that repeat everyday, every 3 days, every Friday, or even every January!

## Why the name _konote_?
This application will deal a _knockout blow_ to your laziness and poor work ethic!
And it helps you take notes.


## Installation

```gh repo clone KarthikB-dev/konote```


## Operating system support
Note that while konote has only been tested on GNU/Linux systems (specifically Ubuntu), it may work on other operating systems because it makes use of system agnostic packages (such as `pathlib`)

## What is konote in one sentence?
A notetaking application that helps you organize a great deal of notes, and that helps you apply 
[evidence based study tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5A26Sc63F0) like active recall and spaced repetition.


## Why the name _konote_?
This application will deal a _knockout blow_ to your laziness and poor work ethic!
And it helps you take notes.


## Installation

```gh repo clone KarthikB-dev/konote```


Note that konote has only been testing on GNU/Linux systems. Windows and Mac OS support will come in the future
after the switch from ```os.system()``` to ```pathlib``` is made.

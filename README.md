# konote
This project has not yet been completed and so has very limited functionality as of now.


## What is konote in one sentence?
konote is a notetaking application that helps you take organized notes, and also will have
built in functionality that help you apply evidence based study tips like active recall and
space repetition.


## Why the name _konote_?
This application will deal a knockout blow to your laziness and poor work ethic!


## I'm interested. Tell me more!
konote has two main functions. The first is to help you organize information as you read it.
This will create strengthen the organization of the topic in your mind. It's expected that you
won't retain all the information on your first pass through the chapter, which bring us to
applying active recall. Within this tree structure of notes, you create practice questions for
yourself. When you return to your notes to study, you hide the answer, and only reveal the answer
after you have attempted a question. This is accomplished by hiding certain files that contain
the answers, and are within the 'question' directory. 
konote will also implement spaced repetition through modifying spreadsheets. It will write the
name of the chapter to a CSV file, and the next date that you should study it. The spreadsheet
will also have user input about how comfortable you were with your chapter, i.e. a score
of 1-5 on how comfortable you were with the project.
